            The handlers for User Node Mapping are now registered internally by ESP RainMaker core,
            by registering to appropriate Wi-Fi Provisioning events. If your application code also

            This enables the additional user id checks during user node mapping. Whenever a new user
            id is received, it is checked against the existing user id in NVS. If there is a mismatch,
            or if no user id exists in NVS, this is considered as a reset state and the same is reported
            to the ESP RainMaker Cloud during the User Node association MQTT Publish so that the cloud
